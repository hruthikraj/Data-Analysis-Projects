# AtliQ Mart - Supply Chain Analytics Dashboard

### Problem Statement

AtliQ Mart, a growing FMCG manufacturer based in Gujarat, India, is currently operational in Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara, with plans to expand to other Tier-1 cities within the next two years. The company is experiencing issues with a few key customers not renewing their annual contracts, largely due to service problems. Specifically, there are concerns about the **on-time** and **in-full** delivery of products, which may have led to customer dissatisfaction.

The company’s management seeks to resolve these issues before expanding into new markets. To address the problem, the **Supply Chain Analytics team** has been tasked with measuring and tracking customer orders' service levels on a daily basis. This tracking will focus on the **On-Time Delivery (OT)**, **In-Full Delivery (IF)**, and **On-Time in Full (OTIF)** metrics, comparing daily performance against customer-specific targets.

### **Business Problem**
AtliQ Mart needs to measure and track daily performance on the following key delivery metrics for their customers:
- **On-Time Delivery (OT) %**
- **In-Full Delivery (IF) %**
- **On-Time in Full (OTIF) %**

The purpose of tracking these metrics is to:
- **Identify areas of service improvement** and prevent future issues with delivery performance.
- **Provide real-time insights** to allow the company to respond quickly to delivery failures.
- **Ensure customer satisfaction** and protect critical contracts before expansion into new cities.

### **Project Task**

As Peter Pandey, the newly hired data analyst in the **Supply Chain Team**, your task is to build an **interactive dashboard** that tracks the key delivery metrics. You will also need to create relevant insights that go beyond the metrics list provided during the stakeholder meeting.

#### **Key Tasks:**
1. **Create Metrics:**
   - Calculate **On-Time Delivery (OT) %**: Percentage of customer orders delivered on time.
   - Calculate **In-Full Delivery (IF) %**: Percentage of customer orders delivered in full.
   - Calculate **On-Time in Full (OTIF) %**: Percentage of customer orders delivered both on time and in full.

2. **Dashboard Design:**
   - Build a dashboard that allows stakeholders to track and measure delivery performance for each customer, displaying the metrics above.
   - Include visual representations such as bar charts, line graphs, and KPIs for real-time monitoring.

3. **Generate Insights:**
   - Analyze the data to extract meaningful insights that could help in improving service delivery.
   - Suggest actionable improvements based on the trends observed in the data.

### **Business Review Meeting Notes**

- During the stakeholder meeting, key requirements were shared in a comic format, outlining the **metric definitions** and **targets** for each customer.
- The stakeholders expressed that the **on-time** and **in-full** delivery rates need to be measured daily, and the team must be able to swiftly identify performance issues.

---

### **Provided Resources:**
- **Metadata**: Includes definitions of key fields in the dataset.
- **Relevant Business Knowledge**: Documents explaining customer expectations, service level agreements (SLAs), and the importance of OTIF in the FMCG sector.
- **Stakeholder Meeting Transcript**: A transcript of the stakeholder meeting outlining the requirements and expectations.

### **Metrics Calculation Examples:**
1. **On-Time Delivery (OT) %**: 
   - Formula:  
     \[
     \text{OT \%} = \left(\frac{\text{Orders Delivered On Time}}{\text{Total Orders}}\right) \times 100
     \]

2. **In-Full Delivery (IF) %**: 
   - Formula:  
     \[
     \text{IF \%} = \left(\frac{\text{Orders Delivered In Full}}{\text{Total Orders}}\right) \times 100
     \]

3. **On-Time in Full (OTIF) %**: 
   - Formula:  
     \[
     \text{OTIF \%} = \left(\frac{\text{Orders Delivered On Time and In Full}}{\text{Total Orders}}\right) \times 100
     \]

---

### **Final Deliverables:**
- A fully interactive **Power BI dashboard** or equivalent data visualization tool.
- Calculated metrics for OT%, IF%, and OTIF%.
- Insights based on trends and anomalies found in the dataset.
- **Recommendations** on how AtliQ Mart can improve delivery performance based on the dashboard findings.

---

### **Technologies and Tools:**
- **Power BI**: For building interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- **DAX**: For creating calculated columns and measures.
- **Excel/CSV**: For data source import and transformation.
  
---

### **Conclusion:**
This project will provide valuable insights into AtliQ Mart’s supply chain performance and help the company improve its delivery service levels, ensuring customer satisfaction and business growth before its planned expansion into new cities.
